# LangGraph Agent Project

A basic AI agent project built with LangGraph, designed as a learning resource for understanding LangGraph agents. This project demonstrates how to create a simple agent that can use tools, such as a weather query tool, using uv for fast Python dependency management.

## Features

- **Simple Agent**: An AI agent that responds to user queries using LangGraph's `create_agent`.
- **Tool Integration**: Includes a basic weather tool as an example of tool usage.
- **Fast Dependency Management**: Uses uv for quick and reliable Python package installation.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for language model capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.12 or later)
- uv (for dependency management)
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) if you don't have one)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/osvaldourielfp/lang-graph-agent.git
   cd lang-graph-agent
   ```

2. **Install uv**:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file**:
   In the root directory, create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

5. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   uv run langgraph dev
   ```

   This will start the LangGraph development server. The agent will be available at the provided URL.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can interact with the agent through the LangGraph Studio interface at the provided URL.

To modify the query or extend the agent:
- Edit files in `src/agents/` to change the agent logic or add more tools.
- The server will automatically reload changes.

For development:
- Use `uv run` to execute commands within the virtual environment, e.g., `uv run python -m src.agents.main`.

## Packages Added

The project uses the following main dependencies (defined in `pyproject.toml`):
- `langchain>=1.0.7`: Core LangChain library.
- `langchain-core>=1.0.5`: Core components for LangChain.
- `langchain-google-genai>=3.0.3`: Integration with Google Generative AI.
- `langchain-google-vertexai>=3.0.3`: Integration with Google Vertex AI.
- `langchain-openai>=1.0.3`: Integration with OpenAI.
- `langgraph>=1.0.3`: LangGraph framework.

Development dependencies:
- `grandalf>=0.8`: Graph visualization.
- `ipykernel>=7.1.0`: Jupyter kernel.
- `langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.4.7`: LangGraph CLI with in-memory store.
