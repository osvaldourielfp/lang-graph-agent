# LangGraph Agent Project

A basic AI agent project built with LangGraph, designed as a learning resource for understanding LangGraph agents. This project demonstrates how to create a simple agent that can use tools, such as a weather query tool, while running entirely in Docker containers to avoid local dependency installations.

## Features

- **Simple Agent**: An AI agent that responds to user queries using LangGraph's `create_agent`.
- **Tool Integration**: Includes a basic weather tool as an example of tool usage.
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for language model capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (version 20.10 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 2.0 or later)
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) if you don't have one)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/osvaldourielfp/lang-graph-agent.git
   cd lang-graph-agent
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**:
   In the root directory, create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build the Docker image and start the container. The agent will run and execute a sample query, printing the result to the console.

## Usage

Once the container is running, the agent will automatically execute the example query: "what is the weather in sf".

To modify the query or extend the agent:
- Edit `app/main.py` to change the input message or add more tools.
- Rebuild the container: `docker-compose up --build`

For development:
- The `docker-compose.yml` includes volume mounting for `app/`, so you can edit code locally and restart the container.
